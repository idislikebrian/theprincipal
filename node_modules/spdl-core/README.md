# spdl-core

Spotify track downloader module. Written in pure javascript.

# Credentials

The module need a Spotify `clientId` and `clientSecret` to work, the module provide you one but if too much people use the module with this credentials, you will be rate limited and the module won't work.
To avoid this, you should set your own credentials.
To do that, go to [The Spotify developers dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) and create an application.
Copy your credentials and paste it with:
```js
spdl.setCredentials('Your app clientId', 'Your app clientSecret');
// or
spdl.setClientId('Your app clientId');
spdl.setClientSecret('Your app clientSecret');
```
